I learned about the benefits of creating a compiler. We will use a syntax analyzer for our first part, comparing with XML files (and probably TextComparer.bat). Generating a compiler will help you understand what you need to do to create one. Also in this way you can extend your code to handle things like decimals.
I learned about lexical analysis. When we tokenize, we mean turning each group of characters into a stream of meaningful XML lines. This XML file is something like the thing to the (log stopped)
Our brains follow the same grammar rules that we learned throughout our life, that are sort of 'wired' to our brain.
